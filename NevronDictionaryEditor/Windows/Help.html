    <h1>Nevron Dictionary Editor Documentation</h1>
    <p>
        <b>Nevron Dictionary Editor</b> is an application for editing localization dictionaries used to localize
        Nevron Open Vision (NOV) based applications and libraries.
    </p>

    <h2>User Interface</h2>
    <div>
        The toolbar of the application contains the following buttons:
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Open</b> - lets you open a Nevron localization dictionary (in TMX format) for editing</li>
        <li><b>Import</b> - provides 2 useful functions:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Translations import</b> - lets you import dictionary translations from another dictionary.
                    This is very useful when there's a new version of the localization dictionary, which contains
                    additional texts to translate. You first have to open it with the <b>Open</b> button and then
                    you can use the <b>Import</b> button to load your translations from an old dictionary and then
                    overwrite the old dictionary using the <b>Save As</b> button.</li>
                <li><b>Dictionary data import</b> - lets you import dictionary data from a Visual Studio Solution,
                    C# Project File and C# Source Code File. This function scans the selected solution, project or
                    file for localization calls like <b>NLoc.Get("my string")</b> or Nevron property names and adds
                    them to the currently opened dictionary.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Save</b> - saves the changes to the currently opened dictionary</li>
        <li><b>Save As</b> - shows a Save File dialog for selecting where to save the current dictionary</li>
        <li><b>Not Translated</b> - when pressed, this toggle button hides all rows in the table, which have
            a translation. To show all rows again, simply click the button again to uncheck it.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Next to the aforementioned buttons are the following widgets:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Find text box</b> - finds all rows in the translation table that contain a word starting with
            the text entered in the text box. You can clear the filter either by deleting the text to find or
            by clicking the red 'X' button next to the find text box.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Culture combo box</b> - lets you select the culture, the current dictionary provides translations for.
            For example: English (United States), Russian (Russia), Bulgarian (Bulgaria).
        </li>
        <li><b>Help button</b> - shows this documentation.</li>
        <li><b>About button</b> - shows information about the application and its version.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Keyboard Support</h2>
    <div>
        In case you want to copy all keys of the currently opened table to the clipboard so that you can then paste
        them in an Excel worksheet, a plain text file and so on, you should press "Ctrl + A" from the keyboard to select
        all rows and then "Ctrl + C" to copy the values in the "Key" column to the clipboard. You can also select only
        some of the rows by "Shift + Down Arrow" or "Ctrl + Left Click" on them.
    </div>
